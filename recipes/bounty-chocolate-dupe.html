           <h2>Description</h2> 
           <p>Bounty chocolate bars have to be on my top 3 favourite chocolate of all time!
              The perfect combination of coconut and a dark chocolate topping (<em>which cuts the sweetness from the condensed milk</em>).
              By now after <em>clicking</em> through my list of recipes by now you should know I am a sucker for a quick <strong>sweet</strong> fix,
              using the least Ingredients and taking the quickest ammount of time to satisfy that sweet craving as quick as possible!
           </p>
