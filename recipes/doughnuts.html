    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This yummy quick recipie has been my favourite to make over the past few years.
        Not only can you coat the outside with a <em>tasty glayze </em> of your choice, you can fill the inside with loads of filling choices!
        Below you will find the tasty <strong>recipie</strong> I have been using over the past 5 years.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g white bread flour</li>
        <li>60g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>15g fresh yeast, crumbled</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>zest 1/2 lemon</li>
        <li>2 tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>125g softened unsalted butter</li>
        <li>about 2 litres sunflower oil, for deep-frying</li>
        <li>caster sugar, for tossing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put 150g water and all the dough ingredients, apart from the butter, 
            into the bowl of a mixer with a beater paddle. 
            Mix on a medium speed for 8 mins or until the dough starts coming away from the sides and forms a ball. 
            Turn off the mixer and let the dough rest for 1 min.</li>
        <li>Start the mixer up again on a medium speed and slowly add the butter to the dough – about 25g at a time. 
            Once it is all incorporated, mix on high speed for 5 mins until the dough is glossy, smooth and very elastic when pulled.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with cling film or a clean tea towel and leave to prove until it has doubled in size. Knock back the dough in the bowl briefly,
             then re-cover and put in the fridge to chill overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, take the dough out of the fridge and cut it into 50g pieces (you should get about 20).</li>     
        <li>Roll the dough pieces into smooth, tight buns and place them on a floured baking tray, leaving plenty of room between them, 
            as you don’t want them to stick together while they prove.</li>
        <li>Cover loosely with cling film and leave for 4 hrs or until doubled in size. Fill your deep-fat fryer or heavy-based saucepan halfway with oil. 
            Heat the oil to 180C.</li>
        <li>When the oil is heated, carefully slide the doughnuts from the tray using a floured pastry scraper. Taking care not to deflate them, put them into the oil. 
            Do 2-3 per batch, depending on the size of your fryer or pan.</li> 
        <li>Fry for 2 mins each side until golden brown  they puff up and float, so you may need to gently push them down after about 1 min to help them colour evenly.</li>    
        <li>Remove the doughnuts from the fryer and place them on kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>Toss the doughnuts in a bowl of caster sugar while still warm. Repeat the steps until all the doughnuts are fried, but keep checking the oil temperature is correct – if it is too high, 
            they will burn and be raw in the middle; if it is too low, the oil will be absorbed into the doughnuts and they will become greasy. Set aside to cool before filling.</li>
    
    </ol>
